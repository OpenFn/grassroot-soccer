# Grassroot Soccer Integrations


## (1) Solution Overview 

GRS is working with Dimagi to design and deploy CommCare workflows across their organization. OpenFn has configured an automated data integration solution between CommCare and Salesforce to sync shared beneficiary information and enable for real-time monitoring of field data collection. 

[See here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CXrMYL0hELSeRkjJLUROTR0A3udJ0Yq8PQZhUtTQokk/edit#gid=544330146) for the data element mapping specification.



## (2) Integration Flows
The solution is a one-way CommCare-to-Salesforce integration that connects the following CommCare forms. These workflows have been updated in June 2025 in line with GRS's migration to a new Salesforce org(Amp Impact) which uses [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pJeABynp42uQbumfYj0MaBmlBWn00ZDF/view?usp=drive_link) data model. The workflows below have been updated and remapped to work with the new data model:  
| WF Code | Workflow Name                           | WF Steps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Amp Impact Object(s)                                                                 |

## Remaining workflows 
The following workflows **have not** been migrated or remapped to work with Amp Impact because they have been identified as out of scope for this iteration as confirmed by GRS in June 2025.
- Upsert Service Referral  
- Outcome Survey  
- Upsert Register Event  
- HIV Testing Event Statistics  
- Upsert Team or Group Name
  
### Flow Triggers
Trigger Type: Message Filter  
A message filter trigger has been configured for each of the forms above. The corresponding job will run when a form with the matching message filter is recieved to the configured webhooks. These can be adjusted in the OpenFn project.

## (3) Assumptions & Considerations for Change Management
1. **[Amp Impact Automation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VF-JdRQIctpY_b8ErYCbOO_IkveuZNOoYupDYgyWZeg/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p):** When an event is created with a curriculum using OpenFn workflows, **event sessions will be automatically created** in Amp Impact based on **session templates**.

2. **[Amp Impact Automation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VF-JdRQIctpY_b8ErYCbOO_IkveuZNOoYupDYgyWZeg/edit?slide=id.g36e8a6c3d82_0_78#slide=id.g36e8a6c3d82_0_78):** When a **submission is created**, **questions** will be automatically created for that submission based on **template questions configured** for that curriculum.

3. **Event session names** on Amp Impact are assumed to be the **exact same as those created on CommCare**.

4 **External IDs** for **question templates** and **GRS services** are assumed to be **configured to match the keys to the forms** used in CommCare.

5. If **Venues, Curriculums, Sites, Business Units, or Coaches** are added to CommCare, they must also be **uploaded to Salesforce**.

6. Users of the mobile app should always ensure they are using the **latest version of the CommCare app** to maintain compatibility.

## (4) Administration
### Provisioning, Hosting, & Maintenance
This integration is hosted on OpenFn.org with CommCare and Salesforce Hosted SaaS. OpenFn will provide ongoing maintenance support to the GRS administrators managing OpenFn.

### Process for Adding New Curricula

To add a new Curriculum to the integration, please follow this process:

1. Add curriculum to CommCare
2. Add curriculum to Amp Impact
3. Configure pre/post template questions to on Amp Impact with `CommCare _Property_Name` field configured to match the questions keys configured on CommCare
4. Run tests to confirm the curriculum works as expected

### Process for Adding a Question to Pre/Post and Coach Support Visit
To add a new question for Pre/Post or Coach Support visit, please follow this process
1. Configure the question on CommCare and make a note of the Question ID
<img width="914" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0df56f9f-8a55-486b-9a04-4ee7dda916eb" />

2. When creating the corresponding Question Template on Amp Impact, use the Question ID as `CommCare Property Name`
<img width="1056" height="693" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-10 at 16 12 30" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b620d10c-8f87-4c31-af75-6dc14a1b5537" />


### Process for adding a new GRS Service on Amp Impact
To add a new GRS Service for `Aggregate Service Referral` or `Risk and Vulnerability Assessment - Service Referral`, please follow the following steps:
1. Configure a case property on CommCare and make a note of the `Choice Value`(for Risk and Vulnerability Assessment - Service Referral) or the `Question ID`(for Aggregate Service Referral) you have set for that case property
<img width="914" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a180235b-50ed-4975-ac54-5f6701b327c5" />
<img width="914" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eb5e449-7d65-4a1c-8998-00d1392649a7" />

2. Then create a GRS Service on Amp Impact, use the Choice Value/Question ID as `CommCare External ID`
